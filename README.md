# YAWP
YAWP(yet another web player) is a simple web player written in php designed for a MPD backend to control.

YAWP serves as a smell interface useful for controlling the playlist of a MPD servive.
The web popout radio is designed to work with the basic MPD httpd output.

As of right now the program is not modular enough to be called stable, but does function as intended.

## TODO list

* Create config file for easy confiurtion with new deployment
* Simple media control(Pause, play, skip)
* Refactor the code to make it a bit more functional
* Work on mobile version of site
